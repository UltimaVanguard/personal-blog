# personal-blog

## Description

I am creating a personal blog page to keep track of what I am learning in class
and use it as a way to put down my thoughts on certain subjects, any gotchas. A
place to keep my thoughts in one place to use as a review for myself later.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can access the website using https://ultimavanguard.github.io/personal-blog/ this link.

The website will resize appropriately depending on screen size.

You can enter information into the form and when you hit submit, it will save it to local storage and take you to the blog entries page which will show all the blogs you've entered.

If you don't fill out a piece of the form you will get an alert telling you to finish the form.

You can hit the toggle button to switch between light and dark mode which also gets saved to local storage.

The entries link takes you to the blog entries page and the footer link takes you to the footer.

Clicking on my name in the footer will take you to my portfolio page.

On the blog entries page the "Go Back" link takes you back to the blog entry page and the footer and my name take you to the footer and my portfolio respectively.
